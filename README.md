🌍 Hello Github community! 👋 I'm Eduardo, born in Brazil citizen of Brazil 🇧🇷 and Italy 🇮🇹. Excited to connect and share my journey at the intersection of two vibrant cultures. Let's explore opportunities and celebrate diversity together!

🚀 As a Senior Data Scientist, I specialize in intelligent systems, with expertise in signal processing, image analysis, and geospatial data. 🌐 My journey includes hands-on roles as a Data Scientist, Team Leader, and Professor, bridging the gap between real-world applications and education.

🌱 I orchestrated a strategic transformation, developing a geospatial intelligence product into a scalable solution. This not only gave us good results but also boosted the company's customer base. 💡

🤝 With a knack for positive relationships, I actively engage in negotiations with new customers, offering a comprehensive commercial perspective. My responsibilities go beyond team management, encompassing the entire product lifecycle from development to customer feedback incorporation.

👨🏻‍💻 Additionally, as a teaching intern, I contributed significantly to students' understanding of artificial neural networks and electrical machines, refining my ability to communicate complex concepts clearly.

🥾 When not immersed in the world of data, you can find me pursuing my two passions: hiking and photography.📸
